# Tech Survivors Portfolio vs. NASDAQ-100: Long-Term Risk Analysis (1999-2025)


This repository presents a comprehensive quantitative risk analysis comparing a concentrated, equal-weighted portfolio of five iconic technology pillars (MSFT, INTC, CSCO, ORCL, AAPL) against the NASDAQ-100 benchmark over a 26-year period (1999–2025).

The project implements a market risk framework (VaR, GARCH, Copulas) to evaluate how a "Survivor Portfolio" of major tech leaders—who successfully navigated the Dot-com crash to define the modern era—compares to the diversified index in terms of structural risk, drawdown recovery, and tail dependence across multiple market regimes.

## Project Overview

### Portfolio

Equal‑weighted portfolio of 5 large‑cap US tech stocks (20% each):

- MSFT (Microsoft)  
- INTC (Intel)  
- CSCO (Cisco)  
- ORCL (Oracle)  
- AAPL (Apple)  

### Benchmark

- NASDAQ Composite (symbol: `^IXIC`)

### Data

- Frequency: Monthly  
- Period: 1999‑11 to 2025‑11 (≈ 26 years)

## Main Questions

**Risk-Adjusted Performance: Does a concentrated "Survivor" portfolio deliver superior risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio) compared to the diversified benchmark?**

**Drawdown & Recovery: While volatility might be higher, does the portfolio recover from major crashes (Dot-com, 2008) faster than the index?**

**Dynamic Volatility: How does risk regime evolve over time (GARCH modeling), and does static analysis mask periods of extreme stress?**

**Tail Dependence: Do the portfolio and NASDAQ decouple during crises, or do they crash in lockstep (Copula analysis)?**

**Stress Testing: How would capital requirements change under hypothetical scenarios like a recurring Tech Crash or Rate Shock?**

**Risk Attribution: Which individual assets drive the portfolio's volatility, and is their risk contribution justified by their performance?**
