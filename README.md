# Tech Survivors Portfolio vs. NASDAQ-100: Long-Term Risk Analysis (1999-2025)


This repository presents a comprehensive quantitative risk analysis comparing a concentrated, equal-weighted portfolio of five iconic technology pillars (MSFT, INTC, CSCO, ORCL, AAPL) against the NASDAQ-100 benchmark over a 26-year period (1999–2025).

The project implements a solid market risk framework (VaR, GARCH, Copulas) to evaluate how a "Survivor Portfolio" of major tech leaders—who successfully navigated the Dot-com crash to define the modern era—compares to the diversified index in terms of structural risk, drawdown recovery, and tail dependence across multiple market regimes.

## Project Overview

### Portfolio

Equal‑weighted portfolio of 5 large‑cap US tech stocks (20% each):

- MSFT (Microsoft)  
- INTC (Intel)  
- CSCO (Cisco)  
- ORCL (Oracle)  
- AAPL (Apple)  

### Benchmark

- NASDAQ Composite (symbol: `^IXIC`)

### Data

- Frequency: Monthly  
- Period: 1999‑11 to 2025‑11 (≈ 26 years)

## Main Questions

- How does the portfolio’s risk compare to the NASDAQ (volatility, drawdowns, VaR/ES)?  
- How does risk evolve over time (GARCH conditional volatility)?  
- Do the portfolio and NASDAQ tend to crash together (tail dependence via copula)?  
- How would the portfolio behave under simple market stress scenarios (Tech Crash, Rate Shock)?  
- Which stocks contribute most to portfolio risk, and do they earn that risk via Sharpe ratio and performance?
